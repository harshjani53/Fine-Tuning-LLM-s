# Fine-Tuning-LLM-s

Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs) is an online course offered by Coursera that teaches the fundamentals of generative AI and how to deploy it in real-world applications. 
The course is designed for developers who have a good foundational understanding of how LLMs work and the best practices behind training and deploying them. 

### The course covers the following topics:

###### The key steps in a typical LLM-based generative AI lifecycle: This includes data gathering, model selection, performance evaluation, and deployment.
###### The transformer architecture that powers LLMs: This architecture is responsible for the impressive performance of LLMs on a variety of tasks.
###### How LLMs are trained and fine-tuned: Fine-tuning allows LLMs to be adapted to a variety of specific use cases.
###### Empirical scaling laws for optimizing model performance: These laws can be used to optimize the model's objective function across dataset size, compute budget, and inference requirements.
###### State-of-the-art training, tuning, inference, tools, and deployment methods: These methods can be used to maximize the performance of models within the specific constraints of a project.
###### The challenges and opportunities that generative AI creates for businesses: This includes ethical considerations, potential biases, and the need for new regulations
